# Code Quality Tools - Status and Future Plans

This document outlines the current status of code quality tools in the homelab GitOps repository.

## Current Status: Pre-commit Removed

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Status**: Pre-commit configuration removed  
**Reason**: Not needed for current homelab development workflow

### What Was Removed
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file
- Git pre-commit hooks (uninstalled)
- Automatic linting and formatting on commits

### Previous Configuration
The repository previously included:
- **Universal hygiene checks**: End-of-file fixing, large file detection, JSON/YAML validation
- **YAML linting**: For Ansible files only
- **Conventional commits**: Commit message format enforcement
- **Ansible lint**: Temporarily disabled

## Why Pre-commit Was Removed

### Current Development Context
1. **Single Developer**: Homelab is managed by one person, reducing need for strict code quality gates
2. **GitOps Focus**: Primary changes are configuration files, not complex code
3. **Development Speed**: Pre-commit hooks were slowing down the development workflow
4. **Tool Maturity**: The homelab infrastructure is stable and doesn't require strict validation

### Specific Issues Addressed
- Commit process was interrupted by formatting fixes
- Multiple commit attempts needed due to hook failures
- Overhead not justified for configuration management use case

## When Pre-commit Might Be Re-enabled

### Future Scenarios
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: When multiple developers join the project
- [ ] **Complex Ansible Development**: When creating sophisticated Ansible roles/playbooks
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: When automated testing becomes critical
- [ ] **Production Readiness**: When infrastructure moves to production-critical status

### Recommended Tools for Future Use
1. **Ansible Lint**: For complex Ansible development
2. **YAML Lint**: For strict YAML formatting
3. **Conventional Commits**: For standardized commit messages
4. **Security Scanning**: For secrets detection

## Alternative Quality Assurance

### Current Practices
1. **Manual Review**: Careful review of changes before commit
2. **FluxCD Validation**: Kubernetes manifests validated by Flux dry-runs
3. **Cluster Testing**: Changes tested in live K3s environment
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of all changes

### Recommended Practices
- Regular manual code review
- Test changes in isolated environments when possible
- Maintain clear commit messages
- Document significant changes

## Re-enabling Pre-commit (Future Reference)

If pre-commit needs to be re-enabled in the future:

### Installation
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
# (Reference previous configuration in git history)

# Install hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Minimal Configuration Example
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```

## Related Tools Status

### Ansible
- **Status**: Active development
- **Quality Control**: Manual testing, idempotent playbooks
- **Future**: Consider ansible-lint when developing complex roles

### Terraform
- **Status**: Stable configuration
- **Quality Control**: Manual validation, terraform plan
- **Future**: Consider terraform fmt and tflint

### Kubernetes Manifests
- **Status**: GitOps managed
- **Quality Control**: FluxCD dry-run validation
- **Future**: Consider kubeval or kustomize validation

## Documentation
This change is documented to:
- Explain the decision rationale
- Provide guidance for future re-enablement
- Maintain development workflow transparency
- Help future contributors understand the project structure

The removal of pre-commit reflects the current needs of a single-developer homelab project focused on infrastructure management rather than complex software development.
