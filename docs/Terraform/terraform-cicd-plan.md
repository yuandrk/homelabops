# Terraform CI/CD Implementation Plan

## Overview

Automate Terraform deployments for homelab infrastructure with proper security, approval workflows, and monitoring.

## Current State Analysis

- **Terraform Structure**: `terraform/cloudflare/` contains tunnel and DNS configurations
- **Manual Process**: Currently running `terraform plan/apply` manually
- **State Management**: Using AWS S3 backend (already secure)
- **Secrets**: Stored in GitHub repository secrets

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Automation (Low Risk)

**Goal**: Automated planning only, manual apply

**Components**:

- GitHub Actions workflow triggered on `terraform/**` changes
- Automated `terraform plan` on PRs
- Plan results posted as PR comments
- No automatic deployment

**Benefits**:

- Catch syntax errors early
- Review infrastructure changes before merge
- No risk of accidental deployments

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Controlled Deployment (Medium Risk)

**Goal**: Automated deployment with approval gates

**Components**:

- GitHub Environment protection rules
- Manual approval step before `terraform apply`
- Apply only on main branch
- Post-deployment validation

**Benefits**:

- Controlled automation
- Audit trail of deployments
- Quick rollback capability

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Goal**: Production-ready CI/CD with monitoring

**Components**:

- Drift detection (scheduled runs)
- Slack/Discord notifications  
- Multi-environment support
- Automated rollback on validation failure

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours

## Required Repository Secrets

```yaml
# AWS (for Terraform state)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "AKIA..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "..."

# Cloudflare (for infrastructure)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: "..."
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: "..."  
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID: "..."
```

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Already Secure

- Terraform state in S3 with encryption
- Secrets stored in GitHub (not in code)
- Limited scope (only Cloudflare resources)

### ðŸ”’ Additional Security

- Branch protection on main branch
- Required PR reviews for terraform changes  
- Environment approvals for production deploys
- Audit logging via GitHub Actions

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes

- DNS record updates (chat.yuandrk.net, etc.)
- Cloudflare tunnel route modifications
- Adding new service endpoints

### Medium Risk Changes  

- Cloudflare tunnel configuration changes
- New tunnel creation
- Zone-level DNS modifications

### Mitigation Strategies

- Always run plan before apply
- Manual approval for production deployments
- Post-deployment service validation
- Easy rollback via git revert + redeploy

## Validation Tests

Post-deployment health checks:

```bash
# Test critical services respond
curl -s https://grafana.yuandrk.net
curl -s https://chat.yuandrk.net  
curl -s https://headlamp.yuandrk.net

# Verify tunnel status
cloudflared tunnel info <tunnel-id>
```

## Rollback Strategy

1. **Git Revert**: Revert problematic commit
2. **Re-trigger**: Push revert to main branch  
3. **Auto-deploy**: CI/CD applies previous state
4. **Manual Override**: Emergency `terraform apply` if needed

## Decision Matrix

| Feature | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Auto Plan | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| Manual Apply | âœ… | - | - |
| Auto Apply | - | âœ… | âœ… |
| Approvals | - | âœ… | âœ… |
| Validation | - | âœ… | âœ… |
| Drift Detection | - | - | âœ… |
| Notifications | - | - | âœ… |

## Next Steps for Decision

1. **Review this plan** - Does the phased approach make sense?
2. **Choose starting phase** - Recommend Phase 1 for safety
3. **Test in non-prod** - Could test with a separate branch first
4. **Verify secrets** - Ensure all required tokens are available
5. **Set timeline** - When do you want to implement this?

## Questions to Consider

- Do you want email/Slack notifications for deployments?
- Should we require 2-person approval for production changes?
- Any specific services that need extra validation?
- Preferred rollback method (automated vs manual)?
